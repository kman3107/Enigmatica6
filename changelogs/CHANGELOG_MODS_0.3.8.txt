			Added hanging flower pots. They are placed when you place a flower pot on a ceiling and will work with any modded plants that pots already support. Should also work for modded custom flower pot as long as they extend the FlowerPot class but so far I have not found any 1.16.4 mod that does that.
			Sack blocks now react to gravity and will deal less damage that an anvil but more than a normal falling block. You can now also switch out an item on a pedestal using a sack, Indiana Jones style
			All animated tile entity are now drawn using a different method that should give them proper shading and ambient occlusion to make them blend better with normal blocks

			You can shift right click to rotate a crank counter clockwise.
			Added some tooltips to guide through some of the mod functionality

			fixed some bugged recipes. Safe is now much cheaper to craft

		[1.16.4 / 1.16.5] YUNG's Better Mineshafts v2.0.1:
			IF YOU'VE USED THE MOD BEFORE, DELETE YOUR EXISTING bettermineshafts/1_16 DIRECTORY!
			Many of you ran Better Mineshafts 2.0 with an old version of YUNG's API, resulting in some corruption to your bettermineshafts config folder. Please delete that directory before running this version to ensure your config files are fixed!
			This version properly requires users to have YUNG's API v1.16.4-Forge-3 in order to prevent such config corruption.
			For more information on the JSON-related crashes and issues from the previous version, see this GitHub issue: [https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Mineshafts/issues/39#issuecomment-764189914](https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Mineshafts/issues/39#issuecomment-764189914)
