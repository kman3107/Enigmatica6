	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.9.3-120.jar --> pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.5-2.9.4-126.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.5-2.9.4-126.jar:
			2.9.4-126 (26 Jan 2021)
			Updates
			* Harvesting Drones (and the Harvesting progwidget) now know about Sweet Berries and Kelp
			* - For Sweet Berry Harvesting Drones, Item Life upgrades are strongly recommended due to the thorny nature of the bushes
			* - For Kelp Harvesting Drones, one (and only one) Security Upgrade is vital for the Drone to operate underwater
			* - Same applies to any Collector Drones you might use in conjunction with Harvesting Drones
			* - Note: avoid using Lily Pads around Drones which need to fly in and out of water; it confuses their pathfinding badly
			* Poisonous Potatoes and Sweet Berries can now be used in the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant to make Ethanol
			* Drone debugger now highlights the planned path for a debugged Drone when it's moving, as a trail of particles
			* - Can be disabled in config: drone_debugger_path_particles in pneumaticcraft-common.toml
			* Amadron Tablet: the Order button now shows a summary of items/fluids in basket in its tooltip
			* Reworked Jetboots flying animations/player pose a bit
			* - Player now animates into & out of flying pose much more smoothly
			* - Player has better vertical positioning and hitbox when flying (now possible, if not necessarily easy, to fly through 1-block high gaps)
			* - Most noticeable in multiplayer, or singleplayer with external camera view
			* GPS and GPS Area Tools tooltip now show the blockname(s) for the block(s) at the selected position(s)
			* - Only if those positions are actually chunkloaded, and remember that the GPS/GPS Area Tools aren't dimension-aware, so it's the block in the current world, not the world in which the tool was originally clicked
			* New food item: Salmon Tempura
			* - Equivalent in food value to Cod n' Chips (i.e. very nutritious)
			* - A good alternative if you're in an area with abundant Salmon but no Cod...
			* - See JEI for how to make it!
			Fixes
			* Fixed Block Tracker block highlight frames sometimes not rendering behind solid blocks
			* Fixed Pneumatic Armor pressure display panel not fully opening when Pneumatic Helmet first equipped
			* Fixed shaped recipe for Assembly IO Import Unit producing an Assembly IO Export Unit
			* Fix enchantments getting lost when using Pressure Chamber to transfer enchantments from Enchanted Book to enchantable item
			* - If the book had multiple enchantments, some of which were applicable to the item, and some not, the inapplicable enchantments would be lost forever
			* - Now any such enchantments stay on the book
			* - Also fixed Pressure Chamber enchanting being able to add conflicting enchantments to an item (e.g. both Sharpness and Smite)
			* Fixed Amadron allowing orders too big for a single Amadrone to carry (>36 itemstacks or >576 buckets of fluid)
			* - GUI now shows an error if you try to order too much at once; split your order into multiple orders
			* Fixed Amadron tablet not working with Mekanism (and possibly other) fluid tanks
			* - Technical detail: no longer checks for a fluid or item capability on the null face, but instead tries each face of the block to find a valid fluid or item capability
			* Fixed Amadron "Add Trade" sub-gui only being openable once (until main Amadron GUI is closed)
			* Fixed intermittent Aerial Interface CME crashes when changing dimension
			* - Aerial Interface player tracking should be much more reliable overall now
			* Fixed Nether Portal screen overlay (when player is standing in portal) rendering completely solid when Pneumatic Helmet equipped, effectively blinding the player
			* Fixed Pneumatic Armor initialisation progress bars not going away (and "low pressure" message spam) if player wearing any armor pieces with 0 pressure
			* Fixed (hopefully) client crash when toggling Redstone Module input/output mode from GUI, when using Vivecraft (VR)

	Quark (Quark-r2.4-297.jar --> Quark-r2.4-298.jar):
