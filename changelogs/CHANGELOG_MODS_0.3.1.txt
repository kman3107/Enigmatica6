		FarmersDelight-1.16.3-1.16.4-0.2.4.jar:
			0.2.4 - The Rice Update?
			* - The Rice crop has been redesigned!
			*  - The top half of the crop can now be harvested individually. The bottom half will stay planted, and eventually regrow a top half;
			*  - Bottom half yields a single pile of Rice when broken;
			*  - Top half is a standard crop, which yields Rice Panicles when fully grown, or Rice/Straw when harvested with a Knife;
			*  - Fully compatible with vanilla pistons, mechanical automation methods, Quark's simple harvesting, Immersive Engineering's Garden Cloche, and Botany Pots;
			*  - Existing Rice crops planted in the world will remain as the old form for compatibility. Simply harvest them and replant rice to get the new form!
			* - Wild Rice now generates in Swamps, Jungles and Bamboo Jungles:
			*  - Somewhat more common than other wild crops, due to the rarity of these biomes;
			*  - Yields a single pile of Rice, and can be sheared.
			* - Seed-bearing Wild Crops (cabbage, beet and tomato) have a small chance of dropping an edible produce when harvested;
			* - Wild Crop bone meal action temporarily removed due to an exploit;
			* - Fixed Dog Food:
			*  - When fed to your pet wolf, it fully heals them and grants them Speed, Strength and Resistance;
			* - Added Horse Feed:
			*  - When fed to any tamed ridable mob (horse, donkey, llama etc.), it fully heals them and grants them Speed II and Jump Boost;
			*  - Does not work for Pigs and Striders, as they cannot be tamed;
			* - When players have the Nourished effect, the hunger bar will look gilded and shiny:
			*  - The gilded coating will visually "peel in half" when the player is spending saturation to heal damage;
			*  - This overlay can be disabled in the new "farmnersdelight-client.toml" config;
			* - If a bell has ropes hanging from under it, players can ring the bell by right-clicking the rope column (24 blocks max.);
			* - Some JEI quality-of-life features:
			*  - Press "uses" (U) on a Stove to see the Campfire Cooking recipe tab;
			*  - Press "uses" (U) on a container item (e.g. Bowl) to see which Cooking Pot recipes it can be served on;
			*  - Cooking Pot recipes now have a "Move Items" transfer button when checking recipes on it;
			* - Graphics updates for some blocks and items;
			* - Resource pack makers: I was previously using 'textures/blocks' (plural) instead of 'textures/block' (singular). This version fixes it for 'block' and 'item', so you may have to change it too.
			* - Translation updates:
			*  - Updated Chinese (thanks to WuzgXY-GitHub, TUsama and ChillirCR!);
			*  - Updated German (thanks to SebastianD334 and Moralle!);
			*  - Added Korean (thanks to qkrehf2!);
			*  - Added Russian (thanks to GrayPix and Kanspirians!);
			*  - Added French (thanks to Derrias!);
			*  - Added Japanese (thanks to FEMT1915!).

			This build supports newer versions of Forge for Minecraft 1.16.4 while providing a few changes.
			Changelog:
			* - updated to Forge 35.1.4 for Minecraft 1.16.4.
			* - add tags to raw bitumen for mod compatibility.
			* - added (partial) Russian language (credits to DrHesperus on Github).
			* - changed steel craft duration: it takes now longer to process iron into steel and costs more in fuel so other mods adding steel crafts with machines now have more interest.
			* - added bituminous coal (craft: one coal surrounded by 8 raw bitumen = 8 bituminous coal): this allows raw bitumen to be converted into fuel. 8 bituminous coals can smelt 10 items, which is a bit more than one coal.

Also cleanup/overhaul a bunch of our existing command implementations, adding more potential argument combinations and opening up a bunch of the commands to being ran through the console or via command blocks
			[46f4daa](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/46f4daa195f0543e1442c90cfd135b6d5dd68a78) - Cleanup a bit of code related to structure validation: - Added comments to VoxelPlane#merge and Structure#add - Renamed hasController to hasFrame for VoxelPlane - Made it so that if we are inheriting a major plane from a structure and already have a minor plane in the location that we don't just basically ignore the minor plane and we take it into account - Slightly optimize structure and plane merging - Take source node's structure instead of adjacent structure as the source structure if the sizes are equal so that if we have one glass and one frame then it properly adds the glass to the frame instead of the frame to the glass (this could cause fusion reactors mostly made with glass to not always form properly [#6722](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6722)) - Properly pass the right click to super from laser focus matrix when not in creative so as to allow the configurator to perform structure validation checks
			[0b8d55b](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/0b8d55b1c2964d841844722eb073cea428eb9764) - Update deps, and adjust for the new cursemaven syntax which requires the project id
			[bc12f54](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/bc12f54ba7619cda93020065a86a1ec702333c4f) - Adjust how we block mobs from spawning to use the vanilla way instead of the forge hook as we don't care about placement type, and there are some places that don't have placement type that don't call the forge method. [#6730](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6730) Internal multiblocks now all mimic induction cells and providers, in that they never allow mobs to spawn on them, and multiblock frames now are slightly smarter and only allow spawning on them if they are formed AND inside the multiblock. This means that mobs can now spawn on top of formed multiblocks. NOTE: Light overlay mods won't show the fact they can spawn on top of formed multiblocks properly as we don't sync the structure data to the client (it isn't worth it), so we only can do a rough estimate and see if the structure is formed or not
			[b20a18d](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/b20a18d167833942f46f5598ecd903dfdc97b738) - Allow forcefully extracting out of chemical dissolution chambers if the side config has a side set to output, instead of only allowing auto eject [#6764](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6764)

Also adjust the base attenuation range for wind generators and solar generators from 16 blocks to 8 to be less intrusive as they are passive generators. Also move the sound location for wind generators from the bottom block to the top block where the rotor is
			[8f33f27](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/8f33f2758e0c4f85a5149a44a98bcb0b0ec09e9a) - Add utility method to IInventorySlot that mimics our other handlers for setting the contents to empty

			[ad98ebb](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ad98ebbbdf731a2d7e879ee2cddb50daea72a7ff) - Bump min forge version to 35.1.0 so as to ensure that things properly invalidate capabilities. Note: This means we are dropping support for 1.16.3, but given 99% of mods are compatible out of the box with 1.16.4, there is no real reason to continue using 1.16.3
			[1a44a71](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1a44a712afb853208f89929a0e8b2efb54ce2419) - Make factories only run auto sort if something changed and it needs to be ran instead of running it every tick when it isn't needed
			[27c01b9](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/27c01b9c9e4666c77706100a03d7d081d6a9d314) - Improve handling of factories when an item inside of it may no longer be valid due to a reload and the recipes having been removed: - Fix upgrading factories with invalid contents from recipes being removed causing crashes instead of gracefully upgrading. - Instead of checking isItemValid for factory auto sort, just do unchecked setting to remove the overhead of the edge case of recipes changing and the contents no longer being valid Also make it so that the client doesn't fail to render items in inventories if they are not valid for the slot (for example if a recipe was removed and the item is still in it), so that the client is then able to properly remove the item from the slot
			[72db76d](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/72db76d5b1e2cfd91e115b00f352c4e76baa0367) - Slightly improve performance of some things by keeping track of chunk positions as longs

			[bc12f54](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/bc12f54ba7619cda93020065a86a1ec702333c4f) - Adjust how we block mobs from spawning to use the vanilla way instead of the forge hook as we don't care about placement type, and there are some places that don't have placement type that don't call the forge method. [#6730](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6730) Internal multiblocks now all mimic induction cells and providers, in that they never allow mobs to spawn on them, and multiblock frames now are slightly smarter and only allow spawning on them if they are formed AND inside the multiblock. This means that mobs can now spawn on top of formed multiblocks. NOTE: Light overlay mods won't show the fact they can spawn on top of formed multiblocks properly as we don't sync the structure data to the client (it isn't worth it), so we only can do a rough estimate and see if the structure is formed or not

		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8l:
			Pedestals - The Storage Update!
			Fixed:
			* There was an Infinite power bug with the Dis-Enchanting Generator in packs that had ways to get above 50% efficiency, that was fixed.
			* Fixed some enchanting issues with Pedestals Enchants, with the exception of COFH Ensorcellation mod 'Soulbound', no other mods enchants should be enchantable through normal means on pedestal upgrades/focused books.
			* Cobble Gen Upgrade now displays its entire storage inventory when used with most storage mods. So you can now hook this up to your AE2 or RS systems and pull cobble out, or insert cobble into it!
			* Fixed the Energy Export not sending items that were full of energy.
			Added:
			* Item Tank: Crafted with an upgrade base + chest, this will store 4 chests inventories worth of 1 item by default. this can be enchanted with capacity to store more items, up to 2billion.
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8k:
			Bug Fix Weekly Update
			Fixed:
			* Filtered Restock upgrade not actually checking which stack its restocking.
			* Fixed a spelling mistake in the en_us translations.
			* Fixed a fluid crafter "slot out of bounds" crash
			* Merged a fix from nikita488 that fixes the Upgrades looking darker then intended.
			* Fixed the quarry block mined particles appearing at the top instead of at the center.
			New or Updated Features:
			* New [WIP] upgrade (That does nothing right now) Will show up as a texture error in JEI/Creative Tab, will be a new generator type in the future.
			* Added back in the ability to hold a linking tool in the off hand with a receiver pedestal link stored, and place pedestals from the main hand, automatically connecting them together.
			* Fixed Filtered Magnets not using the Area for width and range for height enchantments properly.
			* Energy Transfer rate within the PEN is now set to max 20k/tick instead of being based on the upgrades capacity.
			* Added a new generator called the Dis Enchantment Generator, Dropping enchanted items on the generator will fuel it, returning the unenchanted items to the pedestal to be transferred out. Fuel efficiency can be increased by surrounding it with blocks that increase the enchantment power (uses the same 5x3x5 area as the exp enchanter). It will also increase the speed of generation when the stored fuel exceeds the equivalent of 30 levels of exp (will increase for each factor larger).
			* Updated all max fuels storage to 2bil instead of Integer Max, this will help prevent some bugs due to my lazy coding at times...
			* Updated comparator output levels based on the upgrade:
			-- Default behavior will check the contents of the pedestal stack size.
			-- Fluid/Exp/Energy type upgrades will output based on buffer fullness
			-- Upgrades that have a stored fuel will output based on how full the buffer is for the fuel (buffer is 2billion normally)
			-- Quarries will output based on how many blocks the have left to mine.
			* Fixed the quarries "Blocks left to mine" calculation to be more accurate.
			* Updated some upgrades that should have been able to use the advanced enchantment.
			* Updated the milker upgrade to be able to store milk directly to its buffer if it is in a pack where milk is a fluid AND there is no inventory below it.
			Dev Note: I did server test this but I havent had time to fully test everything (again, I know, bad bad mow) so please ping me on discord or submit issues when you find issues, if its server breaking ill try to post a new fix asap. As always, disclaimer below :D
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8j:
			Additional Fluid Upgrades (Update)
			This is stuff I didn't think I'd get done earlier, luckily for you I didn't feel tired, so have some more things!
			Fixed:
			* Super Special Fluids with extra properties now get transferred properly.
			* Fluid Export no longer 'eats' the item being filled if trying to put an invalid fluid for that item inside.
			* Fixed Fluid Filter upgrade to be more in line with the other fluid upgrades.
			* Fluid Filter(s) now can check items other than buckets, with fluids in them.
			Added:
			* Fluid Filtered Import, will only take fluids from tanks or items if it can send that fluid to another pedestal.
			* Fluid Crafter/ Fluid Crafting Placeholder, Fluid Crafter can now craft recipes that use buckets of fluid (using the fluid from its buffer), the Fluid Crafting Placeholder tells the crafter where that fluid bucket should go in the recipe, otherwise this upgrade functions just like the normal crafting upgrades.
			* Added a way to empty any fluid upgrade, with the Upgrade Tool in the players off hand, crouch + right click a fluid upgrade on any block, it will clear any fluid stored, and give you a confirmation message.
			Note from the Dev: This version is still not tested 100% but it is more tested than 0.8i. I mainly tested this against Immersive Engineering, Its refinery and mixer machines since the latter can make potion fluids that are not normally a thing. So I feel the fluid system should be relatively bug free, but as always...
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8i:
			Fluid Transferring Update!
			This update adds the majority of the fluid related upgrades for pedestals.
			Fixes in this version:
			* Fixed some upgrades that wouldn't work in other dimensions than the overworld.
			* Fixed some issues where sometimes transferring energy would dupe it.
			* Fixed an issue with sending energy where it would send based on the buffer size of the sender.
			* Fixed the energy importer not taking energy out of some energy blocks, this should also fix some issues with the energy exporter not being able to put energy into some energy blocks/machines.
			* Fixed a server sided crash with the auto attacker.
			* Fixed grindstone not grinding enchants off of enchanted books.
			* Fixed a tooltip on the crafter upgrade.
			Added in this version:
			* Void Upgrade now has 3 types, They all act like the normal one, but the Energy one can void energy in the PEN, and the fluid one can void fluids in the PFN.
			* Fluid Pump, pumps fluids out of the area 'above' it (work area is similar to the Quarry or Chopper)
			* Fluid Drain, takes fluid from the pedestal and places it in world in its "work area"
			* Fluid Relay, Relays fluids over long distances.
			* Fluid Tank, Stores a large amount of fluid.
			* Fluid Filter, Checks an inventory below for a bucket of the fluid being filtered (Whitelist and Blacklist filters)
			* Fluid Filtered Pump, Checks an inventory below for a bucket of the fluid being filtered (Whitelist and Blacklist filters), Will only pump based on the filtered fluid(s).
			* Fluid Import, Takes fluids from items or tanks 'below' and imports it to the Pedestal Fluid Network (PFN)
			* Fluid Export, Takes fluids from the PFN and puts it in items or in tanks 'below' it.
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

			* - The tile can be now made invisible via GUI checkbox, showing only the text and/or items on the tile
			* Elevator pressure mechanics (for stacked elevators specifically) have been reworked
			* - All lower Elevator Bases in a stack now have their own air storage, unlike previous versions where they just "proxied" the top elevator in the stack
			* - The old system never worked well and was just too bug-prone
			* - If you have stacked elevators, you will likely notice a one-time pressure drop after upgrading to this release, due to the extra air storage
			* - On the plus side, you now effectively have a bunch of free volume upgrades! Pressure will drop more slowly as air is used.
			* - Also, raised the default elevator max height from 4 blocks per elevator base to 6 blocks per base
			*  - If you want to take advantage of this in an existing world, edit pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> Machines -> elevator_base_blocks_per_base
			* All fuels (as used by the Liquid Compressors & Kerosene Lamp) are now defined in datapacks as a special recipe type "pneumaticcraft:fuel_quality"
			* - This makes it very easy to override existing values or add new custom fuels
			* - See [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/tree/1.16.4/src/generated/resources/data/pneumaticcraft/recipes/pneumaticcraft_fuels/](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/tree/1.16.4/src/generated/resources/data/pneumaticcraft/recipes/pneumaticcraft_fuels/) for the default fuel JSONs
			* Performance improvement for Pressure Tubes: made block shape calculation much more efficient
			* - May help with FPS drops in chunks with a lot of tubes, and where a lot of block updates are happening
			* Pneumatic Doors now have an "Iron Door" mode in addition to the existing 3 modes
			* - Like vanilla Iron Doors, these will only open on a redstone signal
			* Infinite water source blocks are no longer block-updated when absorbed by Drones/Gas Lifts/Liquid Hoppers
			* - This intended primarily for performance (eliminating frequent block updates)
			* - Can be disabled in config (pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> Advanced -> dont_update_infinite_water_sources) if you want to enforce no-infinite-water mechanics in your world
			* Area preview has been reworked for several machines:
			* - Pressurized Spawner, Security Station, Universal Sensor now have a common "R" GUI button (in bottom right of GUI) to toggle range preview
			* - This is now a toggle instead of displaying for a few seconds and disappearing
			* - Uses similar preview style (and same code internally) as GPS Tool / GPS Area Tool area previews
			* - Air Grate Module also uses this new functionality, but right-click it with empty hand to toggle range preview
			* Condition widgets can now record their last measured value in a definable variable
			* - Use the Condition widget GUI's to define a "Measure" variable name
			* - If defined, the measured value will be stored in that variable each time the condition executes
			* - When a measure variable is defined, it's no longer an error to have no branch Text widgets attached to the Condition widget (i.e. the widget can be used purely for measurement, if desired)
			* Drones will now no longer travel (fly or teleport) more than 80 blocks to a Charging Station when low on air
			* - 80-block limit can be adjusted in config: pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> Advanced -> max_drone_charging_station_search_range
			* - Note that very large limits can in theory make drones teleport thousands of blocks away to someone else's base if your own charging stations are unavailable for any reason
			* Some Pneumatic Armor keybinding improvements
			* - It's now possible to bind mouse buttons to toggle armor upgrades as well as keyboard keys
			* - Fixed integration with vanilla Options -> Controls screen (changing a binding via armor GUI properly reflects in Controls screen and vice versa)
			* - Options -> Controls screen divides keybinds into 3 categories: main PneumaticCraft keys, Pneumatic Armor toggles, and Block Tracker submodule toggles
			* Made Pneumatic Kick upgrade more effective
			* - Increased entity detection area around player's foot a bit (easier to target entities)
			* - Reduced air usage somewhat, especially when 4 Dispenser Upgrades installed
			* - Increased vertical velocity of kicked target (i.e. better at launching targets into the air!)
			Fixes
			* Fixed elevator callers not emitting redstone when the elevator is at that floor
			* Fixed elevator Charging Upgrades not being sync'd to client (on world reload)
			* - This caused client & server to disagree on elevator descent rate, leading to jerky descent
			* Fixed drone not being able to fill bottles with water from water source blocks
			* - Note that filling water bottles from water tanks is still not possible (with or without a drone) - this is intended behaviour
			* Fixed Air Grate entity filter setting (with Advanced PCB installed) not taking effect right away
			* Fixed Security Station GUI rendering lines wrongly and eventually starving the client of memory
			* Fixed camouflaged Elevators rendering unlit after a neighbour block update
			* Fixed Transfer Gadgets not being placeable on a block if a Transfer Gadget already existed on the top face
			* Fixed JEI init bug (causing no PNC recipes to show) if explosion_crafting is disabled in config
			* Fixed Sentry Turret minigun firing sound not playing to clients
			* Fixed Charging Station not extracting last tiny bit of air from items when discharging them
			* - Related: clean up item NBT when all air has been extracted from an item (don't store air=0 amounts in NBT); mainly for benefit of stacking Air Canisters
			* Fixed distance-sorting bug when drone searches for closest Charging Station for recharge
			* - This could have caused the drone to fly (or teleport) to an unexpected Charging Station

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.7.2-86.jar:
			2.7.2-86 (3 Dec 2020)
			Fixes
			* Hotfix: avoid infinite recursion crash when Quark is also installed
			2.7.1-84 (3 Dec 2020)
			Updates
			* Omnidirectional and Liquid Hoppers can now take an Entity Tracker Upgrade
			* - This allows them to transfer items and fluids to/from entities in front of the hopper's input or output
			* - Tested successfully on: players, Drones, Chest Minecarts and Immersive Engineering's Barrel Minecarts
			* - Should work on any entity which provides the appropriate item or fluid capability
			* - For players, a horizontally aligned omnihopper will access the equipments slots (armor & offhand), and a vertically aligned omnihopper will access the main inventory
			* - Note: this does not apply to vanilla-style absorption of item entities, which continues to work without needing an Entity Tracker Upgrade
			* Transfer Gadget input/output mode can now be toggled by right-clicking with an empty hand
			* - Logistics Configurator is no longer required, but still works
			* TNT fired from an Air Cannon (with Dispenser Upgrade) now has a much longer fuse time, but explodes immediately on impact
			Fixes
			* Fix startup crash (missing fluid tags) when Mekanism not installed
			* Fixed Vortex Cannon bug making it less effective at breaking grass/crops/leaves etc. than it should be (vortices missing blocks when they should have hit)
			* Fixed Transfer Gadgets not rendering properly
			* - New entity model and item texture for the Transfer Gadget
			* Fixed Transfer Gadgets in input mode pulling from the wrong side of sided inventories such as furnaces
			* Fixed spurious error icon for filter showing on Sentry Turret GUI even when the filter is valid

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.7.0-83.jar:
			2.7.0-83 (30 Nov 2020)
			New
			* Added Wall Lamps!
			* - These are just simple redstone-activated lamps, in the 16 dye colors
			* - Can go on any solid surface, in any of the six orientations (will pop off if their attached block is broken)
			* - Also provided inverted versions which go out when a signal is applied
			Updates
			* The Jackhammer now takes a Magnet Upgrade, used in the two veinmining modes
			* - When installed, all veinmined blocks will be dropped at the position of the block actually broken
			* - This has a small extra air cost when used (only when in a veinmining mode)
			* You can now quickly cycle the active Jackhammer dig mode with Sneak & Mouse Wheel
			* It is now a compile error in the Programmer to use an Area widget with a type other than Box with those widgets which can only use a Box shape
			* - These widgets are: Entity Import, Entity Attack, Entity Right Click, Condition: Entity, and Pickup Items
			* - These have always required an area type of Box, but previously accepted other area types, silently interpreting as Box type
			* - New behaviour is clearer and less misleading
			* - Existing already-programmed drones will continue to function as before (it's a compile-time check)
			* Programmable Controller now accepts up to 6 Magnet Upgrades to auto-pickup items (same as actual Drones)
			* Magnet Upgrade in Drones and Programmable Controllers now only functions when the drone/PC actually has a program to run
			* Added client-side config setting "programmer_gui_pauses" to pause the game in SSP when the Programmer is being used
			* - Default "false", which is the same as previous behaviour
			* - This has no effect in SMP, of course
			* Smarter behaviour when using a GPS Area Tool to set a coordinate in the Area progwidget GUI (using the "Inventory Search" button)
			* - Now left-clicking the tool selects P1, and right-clicking it selects P2
			* - Previous behaviour of just selecting an arbitrary point in the tool's area was not very useful
			* Shift-clicking a GPS Area Tool on the background in the Programmer GUI will now create two coordinate widgets, if possible
			* - The two coordinates correspond to the P1 and P2 points of the GPS Area Tool
			* Fluid tagging changes (mainly around fuels)
			* - All fuels are now tagged in the "forge:XXX" namespace for maximum inter-mod compat
			* - Immersive Engineering's Ethanol & Plant Oil are equivalent to PNC:R Ethanol & Vegetable Oil, respectively
			* - Immersive Petroleum's Crude Oil, Lubricant & Gasoline are equivalent to their PNC:R counterparts
			* - API break: IFuelRegistry.registerFuel() methods now take a ITag<Fluid> rather than a Fluid
			* - PneumaticCraft "Oil" is now known as "Crude Oil" (translation change only; internal block/fluid ID has not changed)
			* - Liquid Compressor GUI: fuels tab now shows the fluid's mod when there are multiple fluids with the same name
			* Allow blacklisting of oil worldgen by biome category, in addition to (already existing) biome ID
			* - See "oil_world_gen_category_blacklist" in config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml
			* Flux Compressor now has an on/off texture on its front face to indicate if it's currently running
			* Some performance improvements for the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant
			* - Less searching of recipe lists required now
			* Potatoes, melons and apples can now be used (with Yeast Culture) to make Ethanol in the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant
			* - Sugar can still be used, and processes faster than it used to
			* - Beware: potatoes without Yeast Culture will make Vegetable Oil if the TPP has enough pressure
			* - So don't pressurize your TPP if you intend to make Ethanol with it!
			* Mekanism Uranium Blocks can now be used as heat sources, same heat properties as Immersive Engineering Uranium Blocks (not very hot, but last for ages)
			* - They will eventually turn into Mekanism Lead Blocks
			* Pneumatic Helmet Block Tracker: "Miscellaneous" setting will now also find Bee Nests
			* - Useful to find them in thick forests...
			* Amadron changes
			* - Added new config setting in config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml: "numVillagerOffers", in addition to the existing "numPeriodicOffers"
			* - Periodic trades (from JSON files) are now shuffled into the active Amadron offer list separately from villager trades instead of all being in one big pool
			* - This gives server admins more control over how many periodic trades will be shown on each shuffle
			* - "numVillagerOffers" and "numPeriodicOffers" set the maximum number of each offer type which can be added when the active trades are shuffled
			* - You can set either down to 0, to completely prevent any of that offer type being added
			* - Also, "max_trades_per_player" can now be set to 0 (previous minimum 1) to disable player->player trades being added
			Fixes
			* Fixed enablement of reach distance upgrade (added in 2.6.2) persisting across world changes in SSP
			* Fixed Programmable Controller minidrones "cloning" themselves on the client when leaving and returning to an area
			* Programmable Controller state is now properly reinitialized when the programmable item is changed
			* Behaviour is now much more like wrenching and re-deploying a Drone, in that all variable state is reset
			* Fixed client NPE when mousing over unconfigured Coordinate progwidget in Programmer GUI
			* Fixed pressure text on Pneumatic Helmet HUD wrapping sometimes and looking derpy
			* - I couldn't reproduce this myself, but forced a minimum width on the stat widget
			* Fixed KubeJS (or indeed any mod which can modify the recipe manager) not being able to remove or modify Amadron offers
			* Fixed client crash with Pneumatic Helmet hacking of Jukeboxes
			* Amadron GUI cosmetic fixes
			* - The search textfield is no longer focused by default, since right-clicking of offers doesn't work when it's focused, which is highly unintuitive. It's still easy to search: press Tab, then type your string.
			* - Fixed fluid resources in Amadron offers lacking their tooltip
			* - Fixed tooltip overlap on edge of right-hand slot in an offer leading to garbled tooltip
