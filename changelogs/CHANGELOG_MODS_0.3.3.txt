			Built with:
			* Forge 35.1.13 (Requires any 1.16.4 Forge)
			Fixes:
			* Fixes concurrent data access, fixing a occasional CME crash

	Pedestals (Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8l --> Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8o):
		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8o:
			Bug Fixes!
			Fixed an issue with the Item tank not able to store items with NBT properly
			Fixed an issue with the fluid crafter crafting batches larger than it had fluid available
			* Added some small improvements when the input inventory doesnt have any items in it.

			Hotfix!
			Fixes an issue where the Energy Machine Upgrades couldn't store enough energy to actually smelt 64 items at once.
			Also fixes some tooltips.

		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8m:
			Range Limiter Removal Update!
			(Along with other improvements and features)
			Fixed:
			* Made Filtered Export(s) Enchantable
			* Auto Attacker now uses Range, it also doesnt have the constant equipping sound when being used.
			* Hive Harvester can now harvest from Modded hives. By default it will try to use shears, or it will use whatever item is in the pedestal. (Item outputs will be dropped in world like normal)
			* Fixed some issues with the quarries/pumps work area when placed sideways.
			* Fixed the Potion Diffuser not using Range.
			Improvements:
			* Removed the hardcoded limit to range, the enchant still has a normal vanilla max of 5, but if a mod allows exceeding that limit, it will be effective above the default limit.
			* The Smelter, Crusher, and Sawmill upgrades all now have extra uses when their Speed or Capacity enchants exceed 5, maxing as a hardcoded limit of 64 items processed per in game tick.
			* Quarries, Choppers, Planter, Fertilizer, Harvester, Hive Harvester, Fluid Pumps/Drain all got a massive improvement that should make them feel faster regardless of what size their work area is. It should also make them more performant compared to before.
			New Additions:
			* Ender Import, Filtered Import, Export, Filtered Export(s):
			These Upgrades can Insert or Extract from a players ender chest, only if that player is in the same dimension though.
			There is an advanced option to this where it'll use the players inventory instead, the same restriction still applies.
			The player whos Ender Chest is used, is the player who placed the upgrade on the pedestal.
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

	Plonk (plonk-1.16.4-9.0.3.jar --> plonk-1.16.4-9.0.5.jar):

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.8.1-96.jar --> pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.8.2-101.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.8.2-101.jar:
			2.8.2-97 (28 Dec 2020)
			Updates
			* The Coordinate Operator progwidget can now operate upon a specific subset of the X/Y/Z coordinate fields if desired
			* - Choose which fields should be affected in the widget's GUI
			* - Default is all of X/Y/Z, i.e. same behaviour as previously
			* Programmable Controllers can no longer mine themselves up via the Dig progwidget
			* Smart Chest filtering: Alt + Left Click with an item on the cursor now sets that item as a filter if possible
			* - This can also be done on "closed" slots in the chest's GUI
			* - Useful to be able to update a filter without needing to open up a closed slot (potentially allowing unwanted items in)
			* Added Void Fluid progwidget, counterpart to the Void Item widget added back in 2.4.5
			* The Programmable Controller can now charge the minidrone's held item (pressure or RF) significantly faster than before
			* - This makes Jackhammers in vein+ mode highly suitable for use in a very fast quarry...
			* It is now possible to configure the likelihood of Oil Lakes generating at the surface
			* - See pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> General -> surface_oil_generation_chance
			* - This is 25% by default (i.e. if an Oil Lake would generate at the surface, there is only a 25% chance that it will actually generate)
			* - Can be set to 0 to disable surface Oil Lakes entirely
			* - Note that raising/lowering this value also raises/lowers the overall number of Oil Lakes generated, so you may also wish to modify oil_generation_chance if you modify this setting and want to keep a similar number of lakes overall.
			Fixes
			* Fixed Liquid Import progwidget losing any fluid it imported from a fluid block in the world
			* Fixed oil generation being allowed in Nether Wastes biome
			* - This should have been blacklisted before but was missed; oil should only appear in Basalt Deltas in the Nether by default
			* - Config is not retroactively updated; add "minecraft:nether_wastes" to pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> General -> oil_worldgen_blacklist if you want to apply this change to an existing world.
			* Memory Sticks are now unstackable
			* Hopefully fixed problem where Memory Stick XP auto-absorb randomly stopped working
			* Fixed higher-tier Mekanism pipes issue when extracting from UV Lightbox

		Quark-r2.4-284.jar:
			* Added a button to lock the shift key down in interfaces. This is an accessibility feature that allows people with muscle strains to not have to hold shift down.
			* Added a new "Realistic L.Biomes" world type to allow you to have the realistic world type with large biomes. (Server name: realistic_large_biomes)

			* Added Game Nerfs to experimental (disabled by default). This feature nerfs some parts of the game I consider broken, such as mending, iron farms, and the ability to zombify a villager multiple times to get ridiculous discounts.
			* Added Narrator Readout to experimental (disabled by default), an accessibility feature that allows using the system narrator to read the block or item in front of you, as well as other relevant game info.
			* Added Overlay Shader to experimental (disabled by default), an accessibility feature that allows you to play the game with a post-processing shader enabled, such as increased or decreased contrast, or colorblind simulation.
			* Added Simulated Deutranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia, and Achromatopsia filters to the camera.
			* Attempted to fix an unknown crash on startup refering to the Leaf Carpet. (#2767) I couldn't reproduce it so I'm not sure whether this fixed it or not.

			* Fixed Stonelings not spawning in peaceful.
			* Fixed the emote system causing players' idle animations not happening.
			* Fixed the Fiery Blossom Sapling not being tagged under saplings properly.
			* Fixed the Icy biome type not being accepted in the config, causing things that spawn there, such as the Permafrost biome or Forsty Blossom Trees.
			* Fixed the Seed Pouch including variants for items that are disabled in the creative tab.
			* Fixed the trowel not losing durability.
			* Fixed Tridents with colored runes being very messy. They still don't render the color when thrown, but that's a more complex issue to fix later.
			* Greener Grass now applies to the blocks in Abnormals' Mods by default. (bageldotjpg)
			* Modules are now marked as enabled earlier in the run cycle to allow other mods to hook better. (F43nd1r)

			This update includes a fix for legacy centrifuges transitioning to the new update that caused crashes.
			This also includes render fixes for the newly added honey tanks
			In addition a new Kitten model type has been added for bees with a new Kitten Easter Egg bee as well.
			The kitten bee has a .05% chance to produce a cat spawn egg when it's combs are centrifuged.
			It also has a 10% chance to produce a catnip honey bottle.
			It is nearly as rare as the Oreo bee.
			Added a Russian translation that was not included last update.
			note: Not all translations are complete and anyone who wishes to contribute is welcome to reach out in our discord.
			That's it for this update. small but with a critical fix.

		Resourceful Bees 1.16.4-0.5.6b:
			* Centrifuge Update
			This update involves a complete rewrite of how the Centrifuge code runs
			* Added ability for honeycombs to output fluids. Fluid outputs replace the main output when hasFluidOutput is set to true.
			* Made bottles in the centrifuge Optional. Not providing bottles prevents the bottle output (3rd output) from being given.
			* As an alternative an internal honey tank is filled with honey equivalent to a bottle of honey.
			* fluids auto void if tanks are full or the fluids don't match. given the infinite combs this is acceptable.
			* Ctrl+Click on a fluid tank in centrifuge GUI will void the fluid in the tank.
			* Mechanical Centrifuge is not capable of handling fluids and as such fluid combs are useless in there.
			* Added Elite centrifuge which can process 6 different combs at once.
			* It is built the same way as the normal multiblock except it requires the elite controller and casing.
			* Reworked recipe times in centrifuges and also made recipe times customizable per bee.
			* Default values for a comb are 200 | 50 | 25 for powered centrifuge, multi, elite multi.
			* Comb blocks are now 3x the time of a comb. making comb block default values: XXX | 150 | 75 - Note: comb blocks can't be done in powered centrifuge.
			* Added global config options for recipe times.
			* Added Multiblock Recipe Time Reduction Global Config value
			* Elite Centrifuge is twice as fast as the multiblock.
			* Centrifuge can now be redstone controlled.
			* Centrifuge casings open centrifuge gui.
			* Multiblock validation has been optimized
			* Centrifuge Controllers can no longer share casings
			* prolly more stuff I'm forgetting.
			Texture/Model Update
			Default bees now come with new textures and models.
			GELATINOUS and ORE model variants have been added.
			They currently don't come with colorizing textures but will in another update.
			`"modelType": "ORE"` - use this to set the bee up with the Ore Crystal model.
			"modelType": "GELATINOUS" - use this to set the bee up with the Gelatinous model type.
			Set Generate Default bees to True in config to see how the default ore bees use the new model system.
			Wiki will be updated with info soon.......
			Bug Fixes
			This update comes with tons of bug fixes.
			Fixed a bug that caused Dungeons Mod to crash when loaded alongside Resourceful Bees.
			Ender bees should now be less annoying as they check for any hive within an 8 block radius .
			Fixed ToP display of smoked status
			Fixed how combs were displayed in ToP
			Fixed an issue where giving bees a biome white list of ocean but no blacklist prevented them from spawning. this fixes guardian bees in ATM6
			fixed mistake in Breed Delay and Child Growth Delay calculations causing insta-breed and insta-growth.
			Added Glowstone/Redstone Lamp/Shroom light to valid apiary tag
			Made valid apiary item tag - Note this may not be all inclusive due to missing tags!!
			Surprise!
			A Custom Honey system is being added in and is nearly complete but is functional for now.
			Honey tanks have been added in and are compatible with custom honeys. honey tanks will auto fill to ones below and retain fluids when crafted into higher tiers.
			Also an Ender Beecon has been added which prevents ender bees from teleporting within a 10 block radius. Smoke Beecon will be next.
			Ender Beecon runs off of honey to power.
			custom honey blocks have been added as well.
			More info will come in the near future and wiki will be updated to show how to use the new systems.
			There is likely a ton more stuff that I'm forgetting as I'm terrible with change logs. However this update is better than the one that preceded it. Any questions or issues please stop in our discord.

			Whole lot of refactoring to make it easier to extend in the future

		sophisticatedbackpacks-1.16.4-1.1.2.105.jar:
			Added client config with several positions for sort buttons to help with gui control conflicts with other mods.
			Inception upgrade now allows other upgrades to work with inventories of backpacks in the backpack. The incepted backpacks can use filters and inventory operations will honor those.
			Setting is provided via setting tab to allow player to choose whether main backpack or the backpacks in backpack inventories will be used first
			Upgrade slots and all the settings slots are now split from regular backpack inventory slots so sort mods will only be able to sort the backpack inventory and will no longer pull upgrades into it.
			Several fixes for possible dupe bugs when used together with sorting mods.
			Fixed creative tab name that was missing in translation file
			Fixed a crash that occured with backpack block generated in debug world.
