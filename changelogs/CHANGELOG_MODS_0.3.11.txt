		BloodMagic-1.16.4-3.1.0-15.jar:
			------------------------------------------------------
			Version 3.1.0
			------------------------------------------------------
			* Majorly refactored the progression of the mod. Instead of starting with a Snare, you instead start by crafting the Blood Altar. The changes are documented in the guide, and you can follow its "Getting Started" entry!
			* Changed the tooltips so that they are gray, more easily differentiating them from the name of the item.
			* Added the Sigil of Holding
			* Changed the crafting of Tartaric Gems so that you no longer need to use the previous tier gem in the gem slot.
			-> The Hellfire Forge will now syphon from the gem in the crafting table first, and all unused will from the consumed gem will be placed in the crafted gem.
			* Changed the GUI for the Alchemy Table
			-> You can now select which sides that an input/output slot is accessible from. Click on the slot you wish to change, then click on the directional toggle buttons.
			* Fixed Plunderer's Glint not properly applying the Looting level.
			* Also fixed a NPE crash due to Iron Tip. Fixes some crashes due to mods using the ItemUsedFinish event.
			* Fixed the Blood Altar not being able to input fluids. About time, Way!
			* Added new Explosive Charges
			-> Fungal Charge, which is very useful for giant mushrooms and nether mushrooms
			-> Controlled Charge, which will destroy only blocks that match the block it is placed on.
			* Added the ability to apply a few select Anointments to the charges. Only one can be applied to a charge at a time.
			-> Soft Touch, Fortuna, and Smelting
			* Fixed the Living Armour so that you cannot use an upgrade tome to usurp the point cap.
			-> Fixed "Strong Legs" so that it no longer runs the program "CrunchyLegs.exe" - as a result, you no longer suffer fall damage from jumping on the same level.
			-> Removed the direct fall damage mitigation from "Strong Legs"
			* Added two types of Throwing Daggers to the Blood Mage's offensive kit.
			-> Iron Throwing Dagger
			-> Syringe Throwing Dagger
			* Refactored the guide so that it provides +2 to awesomeness.

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (Archived file --> pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.5-2.9.5-128.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.5-2.9.5-128.jar:
			2.9.5-128 (29 Jan 2021)
			Fixes
			* Hotfix: fix dedicated server crash when clicking GPS or GPS Area Tool on a block
			* - Careless use of a client-only method, sorry!
			2.9.4-126 (26 Jan 2021)
			Updates
			* Harvesting Drones (and the Harvesting progwidget) now know about Sweet Berries and Kelp
			* - For Sweet Berry Harvesting Drones, Item Life upgrades are strongly recommended due to the thorny nature of the bushes
			* - For Kelp Harvesting Drones, one (and only one) Security Upgrade is vital for the Drone to operate underwater
			* - Same applies to any Collector Drones you might use in conjunction with Harvesting Drones
			* - Note: avoid using Lily Pads around Drones which need to fly in and out of water; it confuses their pathfinding badly
			* Poisonous Potatoes and Sweet Berries can now be used in the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant to make Ethanol
			* Drone debugger now highlights the planned path for a debugged Drone when it's moving, as a trail of particles
			* - Can be disabled in config: drone_debugger_path_particles in pneumaticcraft-common.toml
			* Amadron Tablet: the Order button now shows a summary of items/fluids in basket in its tooltip
			* Reworked Jetboots flying animations/player pose a bit
			* - Player now animates into & out of flying pose much more smoothly
			* - Player has better vertical positioning and hitbox when flying (now possible, if not necessarily easy, to fly through 1-block high gaps)
			* - Most noticeable in multiplayer, or singleplayer with external camera view
			* GPS and GPS Area Tools tooltip now show the blockname(s) for the block(s) at the selected position(s)
			* - Only if those positions are actually chunkloaded, and remember that the GPS/GPS Area Tools aren't dimension-aware, so it's the block in the current world, not the world in which the tool was originally clicked
			* New food item: Salmon Tempura
			* - Equivalent in food value to Cod n' Chips (i.e. very nutritious)
			* - A good alternative if you're in an area with abundant Salmon but no Cod...
			* - See JEI for how to make it!
			Fixes
			* Fixed Block Tracker block highlight frames sometimes not rendering behind solid blocks
			* Fixed Pneumatic Armor pressure display panel not fully opening when Pneumatic Helmet first equipped
			* Fixed shaped recipe for Assembly IO Import Unit producing an Assembly IO Export Unit
			* Fix enchantments getting lost when using Pressure Chamber to transfer enchantments from Enchanted Book to enchantable item
			* - If the book had multiple enchantments, some of which were applicable to the item, and some not, the inapplicable enchantments would be lost forever
			* - Now any such enchantments stay on the book
			* - Also fixed Pressure Chamber enchanting being able to add conflicting enchantments to an item (e.g. both Sharpness and Smite)
			* Fixed Amadron allowing orders too big for a single Amadrone to carry (>36 itemstacks or >576 buckets of fluid)
			* - GUI now shows an error if you try to order too much at once; split your order into multiple orders
			* Fixed Amadron tablet not working with Mekanism (and possibly other) fluid tanks
			* - Technical detail: no longer checks for a fluid or item capability on the null face, but instead tries each face of the block to find a valid fluid or item capability
			* Fixed Amadron "Add Trade" sub-gui only being openable once (until main Amadron GUI is closed)
			* Fixed intermittent Aerial Interface CME crashes when changing dimension
