			Ported to 1.16.3. New features will come in a future update. If you're updating in an existing world, you'll need to delete your config file to take advantage of the Biomes O' Plenty support.
			Changes
			* Structures now use the Structure Gel biome dictionary to specify where they spawn, so it should work with Biomes O' Plenty automatically.
			Known Bugs
			* Enderman spawners in the End Ruins don't render and cause console spam because of a Minecraft bug. [MC-189565]()

	Extreme sound muffler (Forge) (extremeSoundMuffler-2.0.4_Forge-1.16.1 --> Extreme sound muffler 3.0 - Forge 1.16.4):
		Extreme sound muffler 3.0 - Forge 1.16.4:
			Version 3.0 is finally here! this means this mod is feature complete (Unless someone has an amazing idea. If you have it, you can share it in the [Github page](https://github.com/LeoBeliik/ExtremeSoundMuffler))
			Sounds now can be muffled instead of just mute them, you can set the volume of the sound by dragging the slider (this was already in the beta)
			Anchors are now saved on the player, so each world can have their own Anchors (Unless you're using the mod Clientside only, in that case Anchors are saves on your Minecraft profile)
			↑ this means if you had Anchors you'll need to set them up again (sorry)
			Bunch of typos fixed (Yeah I know, my england is unperfect)
			Added a TIP for those new players, this only shows once but you can re enable it in the config (or just disable it from the start)
			Fixed some GUI problems (Did I mentioned that there's a new GUI?)
			And some other things that were already present in the beta.

		Extreme Sound Muffler 3.0.0-BETA:
			Beta release of The Muffled Project™
			What's new:
			Now you can Muffle the sounds instead of just Mute them, this mean you can set the Volume of each sound (except specific ones like Minecarts, those will be always muted).
			Also the GUI was renewed!
			What doesn't work:
			Well first of all you will need to re-muffle all your sounds and re-create all your Anchors.
			Also Anchors are saved on the profile folder (this is temporary), witch means that all the worlds in the same profile will share the Anchors as they do with the normal Muffled sounds.
			And I may or may not be forgetting something.. Anyway if have any recommendations / bug reports please go to the [Github page](https://github.com/LeoBeliik/ExtremeSoundMuffler/issues).
			Cheers!

	Interactio - In-World Crafting with Datapacks! (Interactio-1.16.1-3.0.0.jar --> Interactio-1.16.3-3.1.0a.jar):
		Interactio-1.16.3-3.1.0a.jar:
			Hotfix for 3.1.0 that fixes the recipe manager mixin crash outside of dev environments

		Interactio-1.16.3-3.1.0.jar:
			This update contains a "hot"(ish) fix for a breaking Forge change in versions 34.1.32 and higher:
			[- Move Recipe Serializers to DeferredRegister,](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/ea8614a75eb25f52f3e1e53d99b554f58e3b70d8) [fixes](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/ea8614a75eb25f52f3e1e53d99b554f58e3b70d8) [#28](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/issues/28)
			In addition, a [Russian localisation](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/53acbfe3e1f9add17a13161edf6e3fef3177af1f) has been added courtesy of DrHesperus on GitHub! Thank you for your contribution:
			More changes *should* hopefully be coming at some point in the future, but I'm unfortunately a bit swamped right now and the current mod infrastructure and especially the UI is starting to become a bit of a hassle, so you might see some more internal changes first. (maybe I can even get this mod to run on more than just one mod loader?)
			Also, for simplicity's sake, all versions below 1.16.3 will only receive critical updates anymore, as constantly adjusting to breaking API changes and such is already enough trouble on ONE version :p

		Interactio-1.16.2-3.0.0.jar:
			Please note: Only the 1.16.1 version of this release has been tested thoroughly, which is why the other two will be marked as a beta!
			To see the full list of changes, feel free to check out the [lag-fixes-mixins](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/tree/lag-fixes-mixins) branch on GitHub!
			This update should hopefully address some performance issues by completely rewriting how crafting checks for in-world recipes are done:
			Instead of using the world tick event, this mod now uses mixins into ItemEntity, which should hopefully improve performance by a significant margin (and actually makes my work a fair bit easier as well)
			Here's a short summary of the most important changes (as well as links to the relevant commits):
			[- Stop recipe cache from going through recipes again if none are registered](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/b30f26169a7290069f52cc684a9ed4a2dd32ab44)
			[- Remove useless "busy" list of items (idk why it even existed anymore)](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/ede22181184370224ecce8052b3acbe9d9705b31)
			[- Comparing stacks should now be done more efficiently: replace required ingredient list w/ set](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/8c22d5df3f229023382bae1b47c85555d70c57a7)
			* [Remove unnecessary duplicate canCraft checks](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/37df60855de69efd8c3fcbdd041ad9fa9e6d59a1)
			[- Fluid recipes now use mixins instead of an Event Handler](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/c27dc9c44a3efc32f15d784908d1f91e767e6ac5)
			[- Remove DroppedItemHandler, it's no longer needed](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/ba45a65b590e93295bd72e26b92808fa81bad159)
			Again, all of these changes are purely for performance reasons and nothing should have functionally changed, however, I am still bumping the mod version up to 3.0 as
			(a) The switch to mixins as well as these other changes are pretty significant and "major" on their own and
			(b) I frankly just wanted all the versions to line up again.

Also make the robit's bounding box a bit more accurate (it was too small) which should hopefully improve pathing slightly

Also optimize image files again

As a side effect of slightly larger packets from server to client for syncing, the client to server extraction packets are in general smaller. [#6501](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6501) Also fixes QIO systems not properly loading any data if the mod that adds a stored item is removed, now instead the item from that mod is ignored (Note: This means adding the mod back won't make the items come back but they didn't before this fix either).

Currently copies a good bit of vanilla code and uses our destination positions directly, but will not fully work with custom entities that override changeDimension and provide their own repositioning code. Once [https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/7317](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/7317) gets merged we should be able to clean it up quite a bit though.

Cleanup handling of security items by wrapping them into our new ISecurityObject handling to allow for cleaning up SecurityUtils a lot and reducing a bunch of duplicate code, while also allowing locked item stacks to be used by trusted players (it was bugged before and could only be used by the owner regardless of the security mode set). This does not allow access to non security items that are also owner items (such as the portable teleporter)

Also make the color atlas fallback to no color if it encounters a fully transparent color as it is likely due to a resource pack overriding the atlas to change some colors and just not having updated to the new slots that have been added since. Also optimize image files again

			[be85fda](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/be85fda3c13c77dec72a9c0b28308f16bbe4e0d5) - Rewrite how we sync data from the QIO to the client to also include a UUID so as to not have to sync the full NBT tag if it is reduced due to shareTag being overridden or if there is capability NBT data. As a side effect of slightly larger packets from server to client for syncing, the client to server extraction packets are in general smaller. [#6501](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6501) Also fixes QIO systems not properly loading any data if the mod that adds a stored item is removed, now instead the item from that mod is ignored (Note: This means adding the mod back won't make the items come back but they didn't before this fix either).

This allows baby skeletons and baby wither skeletons to spawn in nether fortresses again, and allows any baby mob to spawn in modded structures that make use of the new system to have specific mob types spawn in them.

Currently copies a good bit of vanilla code and uses our destination positions directly, but will not fully work with custom entities that override changeDimension and provide their own repositioning code. Once [https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/7317](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/7317) gets merged we should be able to clean it up quite a bit though.

For example sending enriched redstone and iron ingots from a chest into a metallurgic infuser. Also updated some docs and slightly reorganized the order of a few things in the TransporterManager

Also make the robit's bounding box a bit more accurate (it was too small) which should hopefully improve pathing slightly

Also optimize image files again

As a side effect of slightly larger packets from server to client for syncing, the client to server extraction packets are in general smaller. [#6501](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6501) Also fixes QIO systems not properly loading any data if the mod that adds a stored item is removed, now instead the item from that mod is ignored (Note: This means adding the mod back won't make the items come back but they didn't before this fix either).

			One note: In past versions, if a player had more than one Glazing Tool, their modes would be synchronized (they had player global state). This update changes this to be stored per item.

	Pedestals (Pedestals -1.16.1_0.8 --> Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8h):
		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8h:
			Update: Fixed a Dupe Bug
			I have no idea how this went so long unnoticed, but its now fixed.
			* Dropper Upgrade now drops the correct amount of items.
			* Hive Harvester now has a new tooltip warning users it ONLY works on Vanilla hives.
			* Removed an unneeded tooltip from the crafter upgrade.
			* Fixed the color pallet advancement.
			* Fixed death message 5 for the auto attacker upgrade, and added 2 more messages.

		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8g:
			Backwards Compatible Update!
			(This build will be promoted to 'release' for 1.16.4 as its the first build for a new version)
			Updated to 1.16.4 but the mod will still load on 1.16.3 (From the little I've tested, you just wont see any new changes like the new generator)
			* Fixed the Block Placer (This was left out when i made the Chunk Claiming Fixes a couple updates back)
			* Fixed the Magnet and Exp Magnet upgrades to have a height value (range enchant) and AOE (area enchant) that are separate from each other to give players more fine tuned control (These two escaped this update when I updated the other upgrades a couple updates ago)
			* Added a Generator upgrade, This produces energy for the Pedestal Energy Network (PEN) using any furnace fuel items (drop those items on this to add the fuel to it) It will burn the fuel creating energy. It can be enchanted with speed (more produced per interval) and capacity (which improves the efficiency of the fuel). Red particles at the bottom will be displayed when there is energy in the generator, gray particles will appear at the top of the pedestal to indicate the generator is running. Like the other machine upgrades, fuel is not wasted if the generator stops running but still has fuel left.
			* Removed the ability for Energy Import Upgrade to accept redstone as 'fuel' to create energy, now that there is a generator upgrade this 'feature' is no longer required.
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

		Pedestals -1.16.3_0.8f:
			MOAR VISUALS Update!
			(And other updates)
			Pedestal Connection Range is now displayed with an outlined box, nolonger using particles to show this, which improves client fps when using the tool.
			Pedestals now display some particles when they send items (Will improve these later)
			Planter upgrade now only operates when there is items available to plant, it will pause when the pedestal is empty. Should prevent unnecessary checks which will improve performance a bit.
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

		Pedestals -1.16.3_0.8e:
			Work Area Update:
			With the changes to upgrades with work areas that can effect blocks in the world in large areas, some need for more dynamic sizing was necessary.
			* X/Z size and Y Height are now seperated into Area and Range enchantments for the Harvester, Planter, Fertilizer, and Hive Harvester Upgrades
			* Also Added a new upgrade that can harvest honey comb (or bottles if below inventory is supplied empty bottles) from hive blocks (Vanilla Only) Support for modded hives may come later.
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as i havent had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

		Pedestals -1.16.3_0.8d:
			Update: Fixed some Chunk Claiming Related Issues
			* Pedestal Upgrades now remember who inserted them in the pedestal, so any upgrade that would break or place blocks will now be able to do so in any chunks that player has access to (This should fix any issues with these upgrades not working in claimed player chunks)[Currently placed upgrades that require access will need to be taken out and put back in the pedestal]
			* Swords inserted into pedestals with the attacker upgrade should now apply some of their effects to mobs killed, like looting should now work. (Not Fully Tested)
			* Added Tooltips to show how much fuel is left in solid fuel machine upgrades
			* Added some basic advancements for crafting the started pedestal stuffs.

		Pedestals -1.16.3_0.8c:
			'Under The Hood' Update
			Reworked quite a bit in the code to be more optimized and reliable.
			* Fixed Harvester not harvesting Netherwart, Bamboo, Cactus, Sugarcane, Kelp and Cocoa Beans when it was supposed to.
			* Fixed 'Energy' Machines eating solid fuel dropped on them.
			* Added Particles to the Fertilizer, Harvester, Choppers, and Quarries, when they operate on a block.
			* Reworked how Planter, Harvester, Fertilizer, Choppers, and Quarries find blocks in their work areas. This makes them 100% more reliable, and cause less lag than before, but they might be a tad bit 'slower'.
			* Reworked the Cobble Gen, in how it generates cobble. This should significantly reduce the lag it was making when enchanted with Speed 5
			* Reworked how Solid Fuels are stored for the Furnace, Crusher, Sawmill, Quarry, Quarry Blacklist, Diffuser, and Teleporter Upgrades. These will now store their fuel on the coin. Any current fuel will be lost when updating, but going forward, when removing these upgrades, you will not loose your fuel.

		Pedestals -1.16.3_0.8b:
			THIS UPDATE WILL 'BREAK' ALL EXISTING PEDESTALS PLACED IN WORLD.
			MAKE SURE TO BREAK ALL EXISTING PEDESTALS IN YOUR WORLDS BEFORE UPDATING TO THIS VERSION.
			ITEMS WILL BE LOST IF YOU DONT!!!
			So I did a thing... it broke some stuff, but it also fixes a long running bug that was honestly really annoying to work around while playing.
			Using hoppers and other mods item extraction on pedestals should no longer pull the upgrades and augments out :D
			Fixed a HUGE bug with the magnet upgrades (They were literally voiding your items before...sorry)
			I was overcome by the pressure and finally added a way to upgrade the range of pedestal linking, it costs nether stars by default, because wireless transfer early game is kinda OP. (And farming withers with the mod is easy :P )
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

		Pedestals -1.16.3_0.8a:
			1.16.3 Build
			I WILL ONLY BE SUPPORTING 1.16.3+ GOING FORWARD (Mainly dont have the time to support more than 1 version at the moment)
			This version is a 1.16.3 port
			* Should fix the magnet dupe bug, and may fix the filtered import dupe bug.
			* Pedestals that had upgrades with high speed enchant were causing lots of ticks/updates, this should be reduced slightly in this version.
			* Added some additional fixes to the energy upgrades, unsure if this will completely fix ALL the crashes found past 1.16.2
			* Block breakers now use tool types as well as vanilla default tool classes. (Should allow more modded picks/axes/hoes to be useful)
			* Max exp in sxp tank has been reduced, but its still A LOT.
			* Exergy transfer in energy upgrades should be a bit nicer in larger networks, instead of only supplying power to the first connection first.
			* Fixed crash with autoattacker and banner raiders (raider captains)
			* Added enchantability to filtered exports.
			* Updated exp bottler particles to only show when it has enough xp for bottling, also increased its exp storage capacity
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as i havent had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

		Pedestals -1.16.2_0.8:
			JEI Integration, Patchouli In-game Documentation, and Filtered Upgrades Update.
			(And Other Fixes and Improvements)
			Added This Update:
			* Advanced Enchant

			* Improvement: Added JEI Crafting recipes for Sawmill, Crusher, And Colored Pedestals
			* Improvement: Added in Patchouli Guidebook support, Patchouli is not required, but the book will show up if its installed.
			* Improvement: Added localization to all chat messages and items in the mod, this means we can support translations better.
			* Improvement: Modified Energy Quarry upgrade to use the Energy Smelter which aligns it more with the normal quarry recipe.
			* Improvement: Fertilizer upgrade can now randomly tick crop blocks, causing them to grow slightly faster even without bonemeal (using bonemeal is still way better)
			* Improvement: Added green rings to the Exp upgrades to make them appear easier to see in jei.
			* Improvement: added enchanting descriptions to Pedestal enchants
			* Improvement: added shift-right click ability to the Upgrade Tool, this now shows the 'Work Area' of the selected pedestal based on its upgrade.
			* Improvement: Effect upgrade no longer consumes the potion in the pedestal if it runs out of blaze powder fuel.
			* Improvement: Upgrade and Linking tool can no longer be inserted into pedestals manually, this is to help with interacting with pedestals for linking and such.
			* Improvement: Upgrade and Linking tool now works in off hand if the first slot in the hotbar is selected.
			* Fixed: Quarry Upgrade Wand Chat Message for 'Blocks Left to Mine' no longer counts fluid blocks.
			* Fixed: The Colored Pallets crafting explosion effect will no longer break things like item frames.
			* Fixed: Using the new recommended render event for pedestals, as well as fixed the laggy rotation of items on pedestals on servers.
			* Fixed: Switched to using the recommended way to send chat messages to players.
			* Fixed: switched the way i detect dyes and blocks with pedestals to be more aligned with the forge recommendation.
			* Fixed: Enchanter enchanting items with level 1 enchants when no bookshelves are around it.
			* Fixed: XP dupe when multiple Exp magnets try to pickup the same xp orb.
			* Fixed: 'itsself' to 'itself'
			* Fixed: Block Placer consuming more items then it was supposed to when placing a block.
			Details on New Features:
			Advanced Enchantment:
			* Also Added a Focused Book, which is the ONLY item that can get this enchant from an enchanting table, the enchant cant be gotten from villager trades nor dungeon loot.
			* Enchanted in an enchanting table that can enchant over level 92.
			* When added to a pedestal upgrade that interacts with an inventory, it can interact with ANY block or entity with an inventory, so equipping zombies with strong armor to troll your friends with is possible.
			Translations:
			* Huge thanks to Meawerful for the Chinese simplified translations for pedestals! If anyone would like to help with translations for pedestals, please contact me.
			Filtered Import:
			* Will only remove items from an inventory that can be received by a pedestal, this helps keep the pedestal from 'clogging' when there isnt a 'catch all' option available to send to.
			Filtered Export(s):
			* Will only accept items that match whats currently in the connected inventory, the filtering works the same as the normal filters do.
			Filtered Magnet(s):
			* Will only magnet up items if they match whats in the below inventory, the filtering works the same as the normal filters do.
			Filtered Restock:
			* Will only accept items matching whats in the below inventory, and will only accept enough items so that each matching stack will be full, and no extra. this should make crafting a lot easier to do when using this with a filtered import connected to a storage system.
			As always, if you need help with the mod, the discord invite is in the mod listing on the home screen in game. The channel to chat in is #pedestals

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.2.1-32.jar --> pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.6.2-73.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.6.2-73.jar:
			2.6.2-73 (20 Nov 2020)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.16.4/Changelog.md#new)New
			* Placing a Range Upgrade in the Pneumatic Chestplate now gives the player a 3.5-block reach distance upgrade
			* - This does not affect melee range, just block interaction

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.16.4/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.6.1-72.jar:
			2.6.1-72 (18 Nov 2020)
			Fixes
			* Fixed crash with Spawner Extractor on dedicated server
			* Fixed a couple of HUD messages with helmet block tracker & mob spawners

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.6.0-70.jar:
			2.6.0-70 (16 Nov 2020)
			New
			* Added a new mob spawning system!
			* - This is in addition to the existing (useful but limited) Spawner Agitator
			* - New Spawner Core item which can be extracted from vanilla Spawners, or crafted
			* - Extract full Spawner Cores from a Spawner with the new Spawner Extractor (be ready for a fight...)
			* - Or craft an empty Spawner Core and use the new Vacuum Trap to fill it with mob essence
			* - Use a partially or completely filled Spawner Core in the new Pressurized Spawner to spawn mobs
			* - Pressurized Spawner uses pressure, can be redstone-controlled, accepts Speed Upgrades...
			Updates
			* The Vacuum Pump is now more efficient at creating a vacuum (more vacuum produced on the "-" side per air consumed on the "+" side)
			* Redstone Mode selection in GUI's has had a makeover
			* - There is now one button per mode, rather than a single button to cycle the modes
			* Animated stats (i.e. GUI side tabs and the popup HUD boxes for pneumatic armor) have been heavily reworked internally
			* - Player-visible changes are fairly limited, but side tabs do wrap their text better now (taking advantage of some vanilla ITextComponent/IReorderingProcessor code to manage text wrapping & layout)
			* - Side tabs don't scale their text now when short of horizontal space, since that never looked good.
			* - Instead, text is always wrapped to fit the available width and a scrollbar added where necessary.
			* - Dropped the remaining use of raw String in many places, in favour of ITextComponent
			* - There are API breaks for IGuiAnimatedStat, IHackableBlock and IHackableEntity - sorry!
			* The /dumpNBT command now requires player permission level 2 (it could be used to inspect item data which should remain secret from regular players)
			Fixes
			* Fixed a problem on SMP where players get kicked when they are near other players wearing or holding pressurizable items (tools & armor)
			* - I couldn't reproduce this one myself, and I suspect another mod may be interfering, but I've added some defensive coding to cover it

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.3-2.5.0-66.jar:
			2.5.0-66 (5 Nov 2020)
			Updates
			* Support for MC 1.16.4, which is very much compatible with MC 1.16.3
			* - This release runs on both MC 1.16.3 and 1.16.4
			* Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now has "has work" comparator support, like the Refinery
			* - When there are valid ingredients in the TPP, and room for output, an attached Comparator will emit a signal of 15
			* Pressure tube performance improvement
			* - Was unnecessarily computing connections every tick (for leak detection) when it's only necessary to do so on neighbour block updates
			* Programmer GUI now warns if multiple Item Filter widgets are attached to an Item Assign widget
			* Area widgets in Programmer GUI now show their coordinates and/or variables (when "Show Info" is enabled)
			* Drone variable parsing (with ${varname} syntax): item variables are now supported too
			* "Right Click Block" widget is now called just "Right Click" (since it can be used to click both items and blocks)
			* - Cosmetic change only, no functional changes
			Fixes
			* Fixed a few locale-related errors in recipe deserialization
			* Fixed positioning of selected fluid in Fluid Filter GUI
			* Fixed drone debugger GUI view not being draggable (like it used to be in 1.12.2)

			* Fixed client crash when trying to open Condition: RF & Drone Condition: RF patchouli pages from the Programmer GUI
			* Fixed client crash caused by certain mods trying to pass null world or blockpos data when querying blocks shapes for camouflageable blocks
			* - Not a PNC bug as such, but pays to be defensive

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.3-2.4.5-62.jar:

			* Moved Amadron player offers from global config (config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronPlayerOffers.cfg) to per-world file (world/pneumaticcraft/AmadronPlayerOffers.cfg)
			* - Existing player offers in your instance will be automatically moved across, but make a backup of the above file before upgrading if you're concerned
			* - This isn't very relevant for single-player worlds since player offers are very much a multiplayer feature
			* Dry Ice (from the Powah mod) is now treated as a cold source (-100C) by PneumaticCraft
			Fixes
			* Fixed server NPE when drones try to place certain unplaceable blocks (e.g. Farmer's Delight rice when there's no water block)
			* Fixed dedicated server crash (NoClassDefFoundError) when trying to merge drone programs

			* Drone carrying limit is 36 stacks; if more is available for restocking, multiple trips will now be made

			* Fixed init crash which will affect some Java installations (I was wrongly using a library routine not guaranteed to be present at runtime)
			* Fixed server crash (ConcurrentModificationException) related to Skeleton Horse traps
			* Programmer area previewing now disables depth testing (i.e. preview blocks are no longer hidden when in or behind solid blocks)

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.3-2.4.4-59.jar:

			Updates
			* Mekanism integration has returned! To recap:

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.2.3-47.jar:
			Note: barring any absolutely critical bugs, this will be the final release for MC 1.16.1. All future work will be done on the 1.16.3 branch (with backports of fixes to 1.15.2 LTS)
			2.2.3-47 (26 Sep 2020)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.16/Changelog.md#updates)Updates
			* Added some config control over villager trades and house generation (primarily for the use of progression-based modpacks). See the Villages section in config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml
			* - addMechanicHouse (boolean - default true) controls whether Pressure Mechanic houses can appear in villages
			* - mechanicTrades (NONE, PCB_BLUEPRINT or ALL - default ALL) defines which trades a Pressure Mechanic offers
			* - Note that neither setting is retroactive - any already-generated houses and villagers will not be affected by this
			* Logistics drone behaviour tweaks:
			* - If a drone is carrying some resource (item or fluid) that it's unable to drop off, it will now still be able to handle requests for the other resource type
			* - Drones will now also ignore minimum order sizes if dropping off a resource they're already carrying (but continue to honour minimum order sizes if it means collecting that resource from a provider frame)
			* - Storage and Default Storage frames now also support specifying minimum order sizes
			* It's now possible to right-click a Drone (that you own) with an empty fluid tank to drain any stored liquid from its internal tank
			* - This may be useful if you end up with a Logistics Drone which can't drop off its fluid (items are dropped when a drone is wrenched, but fluid is not)
