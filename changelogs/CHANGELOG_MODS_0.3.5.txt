			7.3.0 (4 Jan 2021)
			* A full texture update for the mod, courtesy of texture artist Ridanisaurus!
			* - This is a new set of 16x16 textures with a nice Minecrafty feel; integrates much more naturally with vanilla textures (IMHO)
			* Holding an Item Router in main or offhand now highlights nearby (<16 blocks) camouflaged Item Routers - [https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/100](https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/100)

			* Updated the Regex Filter Patchouli manual page to make it clear that regex matches happen against item registry names, not display names

		 Biomes You Go 1.1.6 MCV: 1.16.3/1.16.4:
			-Fix "[minecraft/BiomeGenerationSettings]: Feature: Not a JSON object: "minecraft:freeze_top_layer"" which would remove snow from all biomes and remove all mod features adding to "TOP LAYER MODIFICATION"
			-Fix embur gel block accelerating players to incredibly high speeds. Should speed players just a tad bit.

	Pedestals (Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8o --> Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8p):
		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8p:
			Compacting Update!
			(and other fixes/improvements)
			FIXED:
			* Fertilizer/Harvester/Planter/Hive Harvester Upgrades now output redstone signals (when using a comparator) that are more inline with what they can work on, and not the total work area.
			* Item Tank now can store more then 128 items, it wont void anything more then that anymore... (sorry, really sorry)
			IMPROVEMENTS:
			* Fan Upgrade now has an advanced option when enchanted with advanced enchantment. It will push any Entity normally, but filters can be applied to have it only push specific types still:
			-- Quartz Block will allow it to filter for items only
			-- Slime Block will allow it to filter for Exp Orbs only
			* Harvester Upgrade now breaks crops with a stick, and not a hoe. this still works fine for most crops and wont be effected by mods that modify default hoe behavior. If you still need to use a hoe to break a crop, you can still put a hoe into the pedestal, and itll use the hoe item instead.
			* Added some more tooltips to a few upgrades to show what enchants they have on them, the auto attacker will even show the enchants on the sword in the pedestal now.
			ADDED:
			* Ender Filtered Restock Upgrade: This works like the normal filtered restock, except for the players ender chest, or inventory (if enchanted with advanced)
			* Compacting Crafters: Comes in 2x2 and 3x3 options, these crafters will check each stack in an inventory, one by one, if a compacting recipe exists, and enough items are in the stack, it'll compact the items, This works amazingly on 1x1 storage drawers.
			* (Blocked) Relays for Exp/Energy/Fluid: These relays allow Exp/Energy/Fluid to be passed through them, but doesnt allow items to pass through. (Your welcome C_K_Y :P)
			This build may have some bugs in it yet as I haven't had time to fully test it, if you find anything new, please report it to my issues page(linked in the mods description page) Or head over to the discord and chat in the #pedestals channel (DISCORD LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE)

	Plonk (plonk-1.16.4-9.0.5.jar --> plonk-1.16.4-9.0.6.jar):
		plonk-1.16.4-9.0.6.jar:
			[9.0.6] - 2021-01-04
			* Fix #8: Crash when Enderman ray-traces block

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.8.2-101.jar --> pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.9.0-111.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.4-2.9.0-111.jar:
			2.9.0-111 (4 Jan 2021)
			New
			* It is now possible to debug Programmable Controller drone programs in the same way that regular Drones can be debugged
			* - Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker and Dispenser Upgrades: target the Programmable Controller minidrone and press the debug hotkey (default: Y)
			Updates
			* Quality of Life: when attaching a tube module to a Pressure Tube, you can now sneak to attach to the opposite side of the tube
			* Updated some Patchouli manual information, primarily to clarify drone auto-charging functionality
			* Logistics Drones can now take Inventory Upgrades (this was actually already documented in the manual)
			* Liquid Import progwidget can now have a definable block sort order (like dig/place widgets)
			* - Previously always just used "closest" sort order; "top down" often makes more sense for importing fluids from the world
			* Drone search area highlighting (when Entity Tracker enabled and Dispenser Upgrade inserted) now only displays when player is actually debugging the drone
			* - Particles are now also colour-coded: brown for dig/place, blue for fluid import, etc.
			* - Also greatly reduced the network packet size for sending these particles: less server->client chatter
			* The Programmable Controller's "minidrone" is now able to path into lava
			* - It was always able to path through lava blocks on the way to somewhere else, but can now path into them too
			* - This is particularly useful for writing programs to suck up lava lakes from the world which were previously problematic to work with
			* - Note that actual Drones still won't path into lava, only the Programmable Controller
			Fixes
			* Fixed client crash on player login when ModernUI is installed
			* Fixed Pneumatic Armor not reporting feature on/off status properly to server when armor newly equipped
			* - Logging in with armor already equipped worked fine, which is why it took some time to spot this bug...
			* Reset step assist height when Pneumatic Boots are removed
			* Fixed certain blocks being wrongly ignored by drone's Dig progwidgets when "Requires Tool" is checked
			* Blocks which are harvestable with a bare hand (e.g. gravel, glowstone...) were being skipped when the drone was carrying a tool which wasn't faster than a bare hand for those blocks
			* Fixed the various PneumaticCraft Reinforced Stone blocks being harvestable without a pickaxe
			* Fixed hacking drones to call them to you not functioning
			* Fixed drones not highlighting their block search area when Entity Tracker enabled and Dispenser Upgrade inserted
			* Fixed bug which could sometimes cause the Chestplate Charging Upgrade to void air
			* Fixed client crash when removing an Elevator Base with Elevator Frames above
			* Fixed Programmable Controller fluid tank ignoring inventory upgrades on world reload
			* - Each inventory upgrade now increases the tank's storage by 16000mB over the base 16000mB
			* Fixed block shape inconsistency between basic and Advanced Liquid Compressors
			* - Was possible to put redstone on top of a basic Liquid Compressor but not the Advanced version
			* When pastebin-importing old drone programs from Minecraft 1.12.2 and earlier, ignore item meta being enabled on item filter widgets for items that don't have durability/metadata anymore
