			Balance and Minor Fixes.
			* Fixed Anvil not repairing at base level, and xp tank buffer size.
			* Fixed an issue where stackable enchanted/nbt items would be transferred in pedestals and then result in the sent one being voided
			* Adjusted the size of the energy buffer for energy upgrades to allow the ability to process items at max speed
			* Added fluid capabilities to pedestals that have fluid upgrades in them, this should allow fluid cables to attach and transfer fluids into the Fluid Importer or out of the Fluid Exporter
			* Added a blacklist Tag to allow blacklisting some upgrades from being able to use its "Advanced abilities" The XP Anvil will be blacklisted by default, since i believe this is the main concern for balance with enchanting with pedestals currently

		Pedestals -1.16.4_0.8q:

			FULL CHANGELOG for PEDESTALS 0.8q
			TEXTURE UPDATE!!!
			* Huge thanks to Ridanisaurus for the new textures, they look amazing!
			* You can usually find them in the Enigmatica discord.
			FIXED: sometimes particles not showing 'above' the pedestal when placed sideways.
			FIXED: Fluid Pump(s) work area defaulting to 1x8x1 when it should be 1x2x1.
			FIXED: Filtered Restock is now Enchantable
			FIXED: Made a lot of Filters Enchantable that wernt before.
			FIXED: Energy Transferring is more Consistant across all energy upgrades
			FIXED: Exp Transferring is more Consistant across all exp upgrades
			FIXED: added missing tooltip to Exp Restricted Relay
			FIXED: Updated Fluid Transferring to be a bit faster.
			FIXED: Color Crafting to disallow fake players trying to call the methods.
			FIXED: Compacting crafter now uses piston push sound for successful crafts, and Fluid Crafter uses brewing stand brew sound
			FIXED: patchouli entry for redstone control.
			FIXED: Books now work in the enchanter
			ATTEMPTED FIXED: an issue where mekanism pipes could see cobblestone returned from the cobble gen, but because it has 0 items, it saw it as air and was spamming consoles with errors. (Still spams console, will reach out to mek dev for what the pipe is actually erroring on)FIXED: Fluid Filtered Import Recipe
			FIXED: Auto attacker should now be able to attack Raiders(Pillagers) again.
			FIXED: Block Breaker, Quarries, and Choppers will now drop XP if the block normally would.
			OPTIMIZATION: Added a 'cooldown' mechanic to machines like the quarries and choppers to stop working if no work exists, and to only check for new work every 5 seconds (100 game ticks).
			OPTIMIZATION: Pedestal machines have been optimised to only check their work area on longer intervals based on their total working area allowed. this significantly should reduce them checking blocks every opperation
			Machines Optimized:
			* Choppers
			* Fertilizer
			* Harvester
			* Planter
			* Quarries
			* Hive Harvester
			* Pumps
			OPTIMIZATION: Added Optimizations to Filters across the board. this only works for inventories that update neighbors when items are inserted/extracted (Wont Work on Storage Drawers). When placed and used for the first time, it will 'Queue' up whats in the inventory and filter based off the queue instead of checking the inventory every time.
			OPTIMIZATION: All Magnets now will try to fill their pedestal with matching items, before it would only grab the first itemstack entity and then stop working. This should speed up some farms reducing the time entities are on the ground.
			OPTIMIZATION: ANY Upgrade that uses "Entity Filtering" now 'queues' the block below it, this reduces the need to check for the block every time when working.
			OPTIMIZATION: Crafters now 'queue' their recipes and inventories. Inventories that dont update neighbors (Looking at you storage drawers) may have occasional issues, but should still work most the time.
			ADDED: Quarries now have a TAG for quarry/advanced and quarry/blacklist. By Default(Respawn anchor and loadstone are advanced, and spawners are disabled)
			ADDED: Quarries have a "cooldown" if there is nothing in their work area, they will emit a particle above them durring this "cooldown" phase.
			ADDED: Pedestals can now accept tools by using the Tool Swapper item.- Tool in Offhand, Right Click on pedestals with Tool Swapper, Tool goes in, or Out if one is already in.- Normally works with most tools, but Additional can be added (or removed) with tags allowed_tools/disallowed_tools. By default:(Stick/Shears are added, and wood hoe disabled).
			ADDED: Backwards Linking Tool, links from the Sender to Receiver. Can be used in any place the Linking Tool Can Be, Also Selecting a pedestal, Holding the BLT in the off hand and Placing new Pedestals will automatically link the selected pedestal to the placed receivers.- Shift+RightClicking this in the Air (When there is no selection) will turn it into a Linking Tool
			ADDED: Restriction Upgrade, this will only accept up to a set amount of items, once it has items it will not accept any more until it is empty.
			ADDED: Recycler, this by default will recycle Tools/Weapons/Armor into their 'smelting' outputs. When Enchanted to Advanced, itll return ingots equal to the amount of durability left.- There is a recipe to allow additional items to be recycled into 1 type of output with an amount count returned for max durability, or a tag that can set items to be blacklisted
			ADDED: Because of moving the tools into the pedestal, a lot of pedestals now are empty, so i added magnet's by default to cover their work areas. This should simplify some setups.
			Effected Upgrades:
			* Auto Attacker
			* Choppers
			* BlockBreaker
			* Quarries (already have this by default)
			* Harvesters
			ADDED: Dev Tool (no texture)[Creative Only] this can read the inserted coins nbt (with shift + right click) or the nbt of items held in the off hand when rickt clicking in the air.
			ADDED: Durability (Above) and Durability (Under) Filters, these will only allow items with durability matching the conditions to be received. (Not subject to the advanced required enchant to exceed level 5 capacity)
			ADDED: Entity Filtering Options:
			* Lime Glass for Villagers
			* Black Glass for Raiders
			* Slime Block for Exp Entities (advanced)
			* Quartz block for Item Entities (advanced)
			ADVANCED FEATURE: Quarries now have an "Advanced Block" List that can be configured to allow some blocks only broken when the upgrade has this enchant.
			ADVANCED FEATURE: Recycler Will Scrap Tools/Armor/Weapons into Ingots of material based on durability (Reposted)ADVANCED FEATURE: Option to Fan Upgrade that allows it to push any Entity
			ADVANCED FEATURE: Crafters will no longer eject container items.
			ADVANCED FEATURE: Some Upgrades can now use a pedestal as an input inventory.
			* Compacting Crafters
			* Crafters
			* Crushers
			* Furnaces
			* SawMills
			* Exp Bottler
			* Exp Enchanter
			* Exp Grindstone
			* Fluid Crafters
			* Milker
			ADVANCED FEATURE: Adding Advanced enchantment to an upgrade can make it use Capacity / Range / Speed OVER level 5 (normal default)
			Effective on:
			* Exp Collector
			* Exp Dropper
			* Exp Tank
			* Exp Anvil (Slight nerf, with no exp cap now, its now 2x more expensive to combine items)
			* Exp Enchanter
			* Exp Relays
			* Generators
			* Cobble Gen
			* Item Tank (Nerfed max storage at level 5, now requires level 8 i think to get max storage)
			* Void Upgrade (Damage)

	Placebo (Placebo-1.16.3-4.3.3.jar --> Placebo-1.16.4-4.4.1.jar):

		Placebo-1.16.4-4.4.0.jar:
			Updated to 1.16.4.
			Moved coremod logging over to the new system in ASMAPI instead of prints.
			Should support 1.16.5 just fine.

			2.9.3-120 (17 Jan 2020)
			Updates
			* Added Reinforced and Smart Chest Upgrade Kit items
			* - Use these convenience items to upgrade a wooden chest to a Reinforced or Smart Chest, or a Reinforced Chest to Smart Chest
			* - Operates in-place, no need to remove and re-add any items in the chest
			* When extended tooltips are active (use F3+H), the Programmer GUI now shows the progwidget ID for programming widgets in their tooltips
			* - This is useful if you plan to do any Drone programming with Computercraft and the Drone Interface
			* - The progwidget ID corresponds directly to the action used in the Drone Interface's Lua setAction() method (the "pneumaticcraft:" prefix can be omitted)
			* Added two new Lua methods to the Drone Interface
			* - setCanSteal() - used by the "pickup_item" action, controls if the Drone may steal items off e.g. Immersive Engineering conveyors
			* - setRightClickType() - used by the "block_right_click" action, controls if the Drone should be using an item or activating a block
			* Jet Boots and Elytra now play more nicely together
			* - When player is Elytra-flying, switched-on Jet Boots won't fire, or use any air, unless player is actively thrusting (holding down Space bar)
			* - Allows players to glide with Elytra and fire Jet Boots for occasional thrust or altitude boost, a nice air saver
			* - Jet Boots HUD now shows an informational Elytra icon if player is Elytra-flying
			* Item Filter progwidget GUI improvements
			* - Add radio boxes to choose filtering by item (the default) or by variable
			* - Cleaner GUI layout: only show GUI controls relevant to the current mode (item or variable)
			Fixes
			* Fixed PneumaticCraft blocks not remembering custom names assigned in an Anvil when the block is placed down & broken again
			* Fixed Pressure Tube shape not always updating properly after a tube module is added or removed
			* Fixed Redstone Module clock mode tick lengths > 127 not working
			* Fixed Computer Control (Drone Interface) not working with several programming widgets (Block Right Click, Pickup Items, Place, Void Item, Void Liquid)
			* - Also cleaned up the Patchouli manual entry for the Drone Interface quite a bit
			* Fixed Block Tracker causing client crash when tracking vanilla mob spawners with an Enderman (or any angerable creature) spawn egg loaded
			* - Caused by [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-189565]() but I've added some extra validation to prevent an outright crash
			* Hopefully fix worldgen-related crash caused by other worldgen intersecting PneumaticCraft villager houses
			* - Couldn't reproduce myself, but some extra validation has been added
			* Fixed logic error in Drone Dig widget item filtering causing blacklisted items to be ignored
			* Fixed Programmer GUI inventory slots getting messed up after closing an item or inventory search window
			* - e.g. right click an Item Filter widget then press "Search Items...", then go back to the main Programmer GUI
			* Fixed Item Filter progwidget GUI not properly sync'ing variable names when GUI closed

			With this one you'll be able to update from versions like 0.9.19 or older without worrying about loosing (part) of sign post data or cage mob data.
			However for caged mobs that are in item form you might want to place them down, break them, free them and capture them again to have them have the correct name and apparence again.
			Added sign post whitelist where you can add other blocks that can act as a post (like quark posts)

		supplementaries-0.9.21b.jar:
			If you're updating from older version please also read the 0.9.20 patch notes
			Fixed yet another very rare crash on startup. All these recent ones were due to some problematic code that I now completely removed.
			Hourglasses will now accept any forge sand or dust as long as they are tagged as such. They will also (for the most part) display the correct texture for such item.
			Added configs to add throwable bricks to the whitelist
			Remade the flute texture, Improved the copper lantern one and tweaked the bellows one.
			Fixed a bug where dispenser weren't dropping a bottle when emptying a jar when full.
			Fixed a bug where one could not shift click items into a sack properly

		supplementaries-0.9.21.jar:
			If you're updating from older version please also read the 0.9.20 patch notes
			Fixed (hopefully) all start up issues related to tags.
			Added bells tweaks: bells will now visually connect to chains and you will be able to rind a bell by pulling a chain that's connected to one using an empty hand.
			You can tweak this via the configs
			Fixed an issue where you were not able to break your own safe when that option was enabled in the configs
			Added some flute related configs
			Added recipe compatibility for Caves & Cliffs Backport mod

		supplementaries-0.9.20c.jar:
			0.9.20-b/c: the mod now once again loads on servers. I had to fix two separate similar issues hence the many hotfixes
			0.9.20:
			Lots of under the hood code changes and cleanups were made in this update.
			I advise to empty your jars and cages and break your sign posts before updating since their content might get lost after updating. Some other blocks might need to get broken and placed again.
			Added copper lanterns, a decoration item that works similar to normal lanterns and additionally can be turned on and off using a flint and still or an empty hand.
			Added flutes: basically a pet whistle that will teleport all your non sitting pets that are near you to you. It can also be bound to a specific pet by left/right clicking one, that way it will onlly call that specific pet, even if it's sitting.
			Added soul in a jar. A spooky light source that can be obtained by using a tinted jars on soul sand when wearing soul speed boots. Currently only renders properly in fabulous graphic.
			You can now throw bricks and nether bricks. Be careful because they might break your windows!
			Captured parrots will now dance when you play a music disk
			Sacks will now have 4 additional slots that can be enabled via the configs. Additionally they will now accept only items that shulkers can accept. Unfortunately some mods haven't implemented such mechanic this way so that means they you probably won't be able to put your generic "crate" inside a sack, but that wouldn't be the case for the other way around. Same goes for safes.
			Slightly tweaked globe generation. That means that you'll get a new globe when loading an old world. If you don't like remember you can use /supplementaries globe newseed
			Tweaked swinging blocks physic so they won't be pushed by non moving entities.
			Changed blackboard and globe stand texture.
			Added a config option to disable dispensers behavior, a wall lantern mod blacklist and a command to reload the mod configs (since sometimes they don't get reloaded automatically)
			All models have now been optimized and receive proper culling
			Added and changed some sounds.
			Hourglasses can now hold any type of modded sand as long as it's tagged as such. they will(mostly) also have their respective textures
			Many small bug fixes and improvements that will probably go unnoticed

		supplementaries-0.9.19-2:
			Quick hotfix
			Fixed a rare crash related to tags
			hanging signs and wall lanterns now can be placed on all blocks that have a hitbox equal to the fence or wall blocks. For example they will work with Quarks posts.
			Changed candle holder item texture
			Lunar moths from Druidcraft can now be caught with jars and have a proper animation

		supplementaries-0.9.19-1:
			Very minor update.
			Adjusted blackboard gui so it fits properly on all screen resolutions
			You can now reset an hourglass by shift right clicking
			Some recipes will not change depending on the mod installed. If you have installed quark or buzzier bees you'll be able to use their candles to craft the related items.
			Same goes for silver candelabra, cog block and colored sconces.
			Improved related recipes conditions and advancements.
			Changed blackboard and candle holder texture.
			added config to disable firefly despawning during the day
			re uploaded cause old one for some reason didn't compile properly
			if you are still having issues send me a crash report

			v1.1 Changelog:

			* Huge Garbage Collection optimization. Should no longer eat up a ton of allocations.
			* Plants and other decorations no longer float above cave entrances!
